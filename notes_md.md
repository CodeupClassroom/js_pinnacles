    * Data types
        * Based on the type we're going to be able to perform different operations
        * 2 types of types
            * Primitive. Hold a single value
            * Complex. Can hold several values
        * `var name = "Codeup";`
        * Variable assignment
            * `<variableName> = <value>;`
        * Variable declaration
            * `var <variableName>;`
    * Browser console
    * Primitive types
        * Strings
        * Booleans
        * Numbers
    * Variables identify values in the computer's memory.
        * They get initial values through assignments
        * Their values can be re-assigned
    * Dynamic language
        * Variables do not have a permanent type
        * Types depend on the value of the variable
        * Type coercion
        
    * Boolean
        * Logical operators, and, or and not
    * Numbers
        * Arithmetic operators
    * Sequential statements
        * Variable declarations
        * Assignments
    * Variables
        * Counters -> Unary operations `++`, `--`
        * Accumulators -> Shorthand operators `+=`, `-=`....
